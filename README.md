Simple GUI for the filestack upload service.

Make sure that you created .env file with variables similarly like in .env.example .

The app can read exif 'model' and 'orientation' tags. In order to check that you can use files from ./photo_examples

The app is now hosted on heroku under this url (take into consideration, that an app instance can be suspended and in this case you should wait a moment)
